Thank you for purchasing this tileset!
Here you'll find dozens of tiles and scenery to create snowy environments!

The folders contain the tiles with the configuration used in RPG Maker and there's also a folder for general engines, containing the tiles in an autotile format (used in Game Maker Studio and similiar engines).

If you have any questions, just send me a comment.

Good development,
- Kazzter
